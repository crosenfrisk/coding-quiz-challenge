### About the Project

When "Start Quiz" button is pressed, users are presented with a short quiz on JavaScript fundamentals. Time elapses in one corner, and additional time is deducted as a penalty for wrong answers. At the end of the quiz, all are invited to enter their initials and view high scores stored on the leader board.

### Challenges Faced

In December, I struggled to get the timer to work as desired. Getting the penalty to register on the timer was not as simple as I had envisioned. I was able to fix this in January.

Additional challenges include: getting quiz question array to cycle, as well as getting option elements to be visible on html page *at times only one object would display while others disappeared* Thankfully this has also been fixed.

*Update 2/16/22: Local storage is still an area that I struggle with. It has been almost a month since my last work on this project. I am submitting what I have with the hope that I can still get help from my tutor to complete the last leg of this project with regard to the high score page.*

** Update 2/19/22: Local storage fixed! High score page dynamically generates and loads stored scores, added function to clear high scores and option to return to main page. **

### What I Enjoyed

I enjoyed using Bootstrap for the first time and liked setting up my hmtl pages. I decided to use multiple pages rather than hiding and then revealing elements via CSS because it lead to a clearer back-end experience for me as the developer. Each page had its own purpose. 

Initially I created three html pages: `index.html ` was the landing page where the user could see they had options to either `Start Game!` or `View High Scores` and be directed to the respective pages. `quiz.html` stored the html layout for the quiz with vertical button elements and the timer in the nav section, while `highscores.html` was simply for viewing/storing user input *initials* along with score.

*Update 2/16/22: After I learned about dynamically generating divs, I did away with the three pages and their links, and simply used `index.html` to display the landing page, quiz, and then high score page.*
### Credits

ðŸŽ‰ During the initial creation phase of this project, I had help from Google, W3Schools, MDN, and classmates Colin @soundproofboot and @Kyler-McLachlan (GitHub username). I also received general feedback from Manon of AskBCS, and Harrison our class TA.

ðŸŽ‰ *Update 2/16/22: My second iteration of the project involved creating a new white board to detail the flow of the project. @AndrewRosenfrisk discussed the importance of parameters with me and was a good listener any time I got stuck.*

ðŸŽ‰ *Update 2/19/22: Lilo Valdez gave me feedback regarding local storage which helped me complete this project.*
